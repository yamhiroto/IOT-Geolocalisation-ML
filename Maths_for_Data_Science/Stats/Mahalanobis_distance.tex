Mahalanobis distance

Mahalanobis distance is a good alternative to Euclidean distance. For any given point $x$ in a set $X$, the squared Mahalanobis distance is:

$$D^2=(x-\mu_X)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu_X)$$

Advantage : it takes into account the data standard deviation and correlation. The more the data is dispersed, the lower the distance is. Indeed, using the inverse matrix is like if we divided the distance from the mean $(x-\mu_X)$ by the standard deviation.

\textit{Note}: Euclidean distance is when $\Sigma=Id$.
